# Vanitas

> What profit hath a man from all of his labour which he taketh under the sun? One generation passeth away and another generation cometh, but the earth abideth forever.

This site will act as a personal manifest of most things material that I own. The idea came from [minimal directory](minimal.directory), a showcase for minimally designed products.

This project will strip most of that varnish; instead of simply showing the best of what I have, it's equally important to record the gaudy, the sentimental, and often irrational stuff I've accumulated over years of perhaps too much of a disposable income and realizing I perhaps have too distensible an attitude [toward material asceticism](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/31/magazine/the-oppressive-gospel-of-minimalism.html).

Some guidelines I'll follow:

- If it's too large for a canvas backdrop, an original photo will not be taken.
  - E.g. furniture, bed frames, mattresses, and so on.
- If it's a consumable or something that's regularly replaced, it'll be excluded, unless it's in a container (cleaning fluid, alcohol)
- Intimate items will be excluded
- Everything else is fair game
